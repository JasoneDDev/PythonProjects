# - Jeopardy type game -
Will have some fun sayings from Saskatchewan and we'll be able to guess letters/vowels and have the computer randomly choose a few and then we can guess at the sentence. Guessing correct letters ups your score and guessing correctly quickly is higher points etc. Will save high score out and simulate pushin it to a server... or actually set up a server and push the data.

# - Dungeon Crawler - 
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JasoneDDev/PythonProjects/master/dungeonCrawler.PNG)
Simple text style dungeon crawler to better my undertstanding of the Python syntax, methods, decorators etc.
The game starts with you entering a door in the side of a mountain side, the door slams behind you and now you're trapped. You need to find you way through the (currently 8x8) dungeon to find the key and make your way back to the door to exit and escape.
The key's location is randomized per game instance.Added player walking history map so player has some sense of where they are and where to look next, can add this as a findable object later. 

# - Profiler -
can be added and called on any function to return a profiler file to them be viewed with pstats etc.

# - PyQt : Fish Viewer -
Fish PyQT image viewer with labels. Three fish pics to cycle through with title. Pretty simple example.
# - PyQt : Notepad app -
simple notepad app I am making and adding to.
# - PyQt : Sticky Note creator -
saving notes to a txt file as sticky notes which can then be read in and displayed as a to do list... still in progress

# Other test scripts
Just some test scripts to remind me how to use certain features and to help me decipher how libraries etc work as I get more familiar with Python and it's libraries etc.
