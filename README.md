# - Jeopardy SK Version - WIP
Fun sayings from Saskatchewan in a Jeopardy style game. Can choose vowels/consonants and also guess at the sentence. No scoring added yet. This "game" is an example of an iterrative vs recursive program. 
Still to add is a scoring system, possibly a hint to the sentence and also unit tests and locks so players can't cheat (pick too many letters etc at a time)

# - Dungeon Crawler - 
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JasoneDDev/PythonProjects/master/dungeonCrawler.PNG)
Simple text style dungeon crawler to better my undertstanding of the Python syntax, methods, decorators etc.
The game starts with you entering a door in the side of a mountain side, the door slams behind you and now you're trapped. You need to find you way through the (currently 8x8) dungeon to find the key and make your way back to the door to exit and escape.
The key's location is randomized per game instance.Added player walking history map so player has some sense of where they are and where to look next, can add this as a findable object later. 

# - Profiler -
can be added and called on any function to return a profiler file to them be viewed with pstats etc.

# - PyQt : Fish Viewer -
Fish PyQT image viewer with labels. Three fish pics to cycle through with title. Pretty simple example.
# - PyQt : Notepad app - WIP
simple notepad app I am making and adding to.
# - PyQt : Sticky Note creator - WIP
saving notes to a txt file as sticky notes which can then be read in and displayed as a to do list... still in progress

# Other test scripts
Just some test scripts to remind me how to use certain features and to help me decipher how libraries etc work as I get more familiar with Python and it's libraries etc.
