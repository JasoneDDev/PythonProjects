# PythonProjects
# - Dungeon Crawler - 
Simple text style dungeon crawler to better my undertstanding of the Python syntax, methods, decorators etc.
The game starts with you entering a door in the side of a mountain side, the door slams behind you and now you're trapped. You need to find you way through the (currently 8x8) dungeon to find the key and make your way back to the door to exit and escape.
The key's location is randomized per game instance.
- add map to be found and when found we can display it at each step etc we take.
- need to add unit testing.
- make simple text based title " Dungeon Crawler "
- try and load sound file? do do do DOOOOO when we find the key etc.

# - Profiler -
can be added and called on any function to return a profiler file to them be viewed with pstats etc.

# - Command Prompt -
return things like largest file on harddrive etc. to show accessing and running shell commands.

# - Hangman game - 

# Other test scripts
Just some test scripts to remind me how to use certain features and to help me decipher how libraries etc work as I get more familiar with Python and it's libraries etc.
