# so this python project is just a simple way to practice common linux commands for the terminal.
# the program will ask to do a task and will know the proper command, we'll just test against known commands.
# if correct we move on, if false we give the correct command and ask the next question.
# will randomize the requests... and try and do different version of the same request / different answers
